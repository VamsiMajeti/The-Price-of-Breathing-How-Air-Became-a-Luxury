Overview: This is a global, data driven project that examines how air once free, shared & infinite has quietly become a commodity. It explores the economic, social & environmental transformation of clean air into a luxury product through storytelling, verified data & case studies. This project traces the journey of air from being a natural right to a priced necessity. It blends verified statistics, global case studies (India, China, USA) & narration to reveal the invisible market that has emerged around the act of breathing. For most of human history, air was untouched by economy. But as industrialization, urbanization & climate change deepened, pollution turned breathing itself into an economic activity. The project highlights this shift through facts, visuals & future projections on how air might soon become a tradable asset.
